This is a repository used for a 3rd Semester Exam Project at Erhversakademiets Lillebaelts Computer Science education.

The project has to do with creating a web service or client/server application, for a real company.

The group are working with a company called, ProLite, to create a feature(subsystem) for an already existing product, called clean manager. Which is a system used by cleaning companies to plan jobs and manage their company resources.

The feature that they requesting is an internal communication system built into the application. More information to come... Once we've had a chat with the product owners.
